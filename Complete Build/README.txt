Welcome to Fight or Flight! This game is a flight simulator.

To play the game, open the “FightorFlight.exe” file. For a review of the controls, select controls in the main menu. When you press play, you have two options: Explore or Misson. I highly recommend that you try Explore fist to understand the controls. 
In Explore, you are sent to a small city to get started.
In Mission, you must use your trusty plane to defeat the F-22 that has been terrorizing the townspeople. The controls are difficult, and the F-22 pilot is the best there is. It’s your job to prove him wrong and save the townspeople.
If you want to return to the main menu, please crash your plane. After 3 seconds you will enter the Death screen.
P.S: Raise the volume till you can hear the background music in the Main Menu. 
CONTROLS
WASD – Roll/Pitch
IK – Increase/Decrease throttle (the bar on the right measures the amount of thrust you’re using)
JL – Yaw
Arrow Keys – Adjust Camera
Space Bar – Missile
Left Shift – Shoot gun
Experimental: Tab – AI Control (It’s VERY buggy and works better in the “Mission” level when facing the F-22)
